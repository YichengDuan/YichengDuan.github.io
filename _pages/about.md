Hi there! I’m Yicheng Duan (段毅成), currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science @ [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), advised by [Dr. Yu Yin](https://yin-yu.github.io/). BS in Applied Physic @ [University of Washington, Seattle](https://www.washington.edu/).

My research interests center on building intelligent systems that can see, communicate, and act — especially humanoid agents capable of navigating, reasoning, and planning in complex environments, i.e. **"Humanoid + world knowledge reasoning"**. My research focuses on *Vision-Language-Action models* and *Embodied AI*. I also have experience in *machine learning*, *vision-language navigation*, *VLM*, and *LLM*. Recently, my work has focused on robotics data unification, action representation, and benchmarking.

Previously, as an algorithm engineer at [ZHIPU.AI](https://z.ai), I designed statistical and machine learning models, optimized large-scale data systems, contributed to the development of early-stage LLM agents, and enhanced backend performance.

The journey is still unfolding, and I’m always eager to connect, collaborate, and learn along the way.
